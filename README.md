### Simple timer used for Pomodoro Technique

This is a simple timer which is preset to 25minutes.

Just decide on a task, hit the timer and **start working**.

Once the timer hits start working**start working**, it plays a bell sound to notify the end of the session.

Then take a break and start the timer again.

Though this project is simple, it helps us understand the **setInterval** concept in **Javascript**.
